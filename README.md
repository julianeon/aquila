## About

This repo was created for a hackathon.

It lets you upload data, then view it in card format.

![view of the data](./public/aquila_data.png)

It won't run with modern node versions because of the openssl issue but, if you want to run it, you can by entering this into your terminal:

`export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

Note: not a good security practice in general but this will let the app run if you want to view it locally.


Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run The App

First, run  `npm install`.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
